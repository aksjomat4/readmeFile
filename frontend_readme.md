# **Productivity Cube - frontend**

## Description
This is a frontend part of Time Management Supporting System. The whole idea is about helping user with making decisions on what he should put his focus at the moment. We create a small cube, which analyzes our day at work and then
predict if the action taken during some part of the day would be efficient or will be interrupted
by other factors.
